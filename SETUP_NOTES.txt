#### WARNING ####
Do NOT use any programs with SQLite depencencies. It will cause windows authentication to fail
because SQLite requires a cursor and the certificate will try to apply to SQLite databases. If 
you are getting cursor attribute errors this is why.

Run describe and frequency reports first and find columns with float values that are very high 
and exclude them from SQL queries when running Profile Report because it will destroy local memory
and cause report to break.

In Python do not perform email calls using the email validator it has a DNS calls that are unreliable.
We cannot use some of the libraries
